# Classic Arcade Game - Frogger

## Introduction:

This repository comprised recreating the classic arcade game *Frogger* and is part part of the Udacity Fron End Nanodegree. Object of this project is not only to practice object-oriented programming features but also to learn to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.

The original *Frogger-Game* is about directing frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards. 

As we were be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine we had to add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the cnamed classic arcade game.

## Object of the Game:

The goal is to collect all items in a given time. 

## Running the Game:

To run a game you need an active internet connection, then

- download the project from Gitub,
- open the index.html file, 
- and follow the General usage Notes listed below

## General Usage Notes:

- Use arrow keeys or to control player.
- Avoid the Enemies and the water as colliding with these will result in time loss due to be moved back to initial position

## Game Rules:

The object of the game is to collect all the items in a given time. When colliding with an Enemy or the ocean the Player is set to the inital starting point and looses one (of three) life. After three failed attempts to rech the goal, the game is over. 

But since the project yet covers only the basic functionality, there are some open issues reagrding the overall game logic:

- adding a [timer](https://github.com/I3ekka/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/issues/1)
- adding live [display](https://github.com/I3ekka/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/issues/2) and [decreasing functionality](https://github.com/I3ekka/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/issues/5)
- adding collectable [items](https://github.com/I3ekka/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/issues/3)
- adding [gathering place](https://github.com/I3ekka/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/issues/4) for named items
- adding overall styling
