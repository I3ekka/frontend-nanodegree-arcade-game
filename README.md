## Project Requirements:

We are be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools one must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game *Frogger*.


### Instructions:

- Customize the game settings from this file js/app.js.


## Basic Game Functionality & General Usage Notes:

- To run a game open index.html if the project is downloaded from GitHub.
- You need an active internet connection.
- Use arrow keeys or to control player.
- Avoid the Enemies and the water as colliding with these the Player will be reset to initial position


## Open Issues:

Since the project's covers the basic functionality, there are some open issues reagrding the overall game logic:

- what is the goal of the game
- when do you win the game 
- when do you losse
- how many lives do you have
