# Classic Arcade Game - Frogger

## Introduction:

This repository comprised recreating the classic arcade game *Frogger* and is part part of the Udacity Fron End Nanodegree. Object of this project is not only to practice object-oriented programming features but also to learn to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.

The original *Frogger-Game* is about directing frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards. 

## Project Instructions:

As we were be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine we had to add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the cnamed classic arcade game.

## Running the Game:

To run a game you need an active internet connection, then
- download the project from Gitub,
- open the index.html file, 
- and follow the General usage Notes listed below

## Basic Game Functionality & General Usage Notes:

- Use arrow keeys or to control player.
- Avoid the Enemies and the water as colliding with these the Player will be reset to initial position

## Game Rules:

Since the project yet covers only the basic functionality, there are some open issues reagrding the overall game logic:

- what is the goal of the game
- when do you win the game 
- when do you losse
- how many lives do you have
